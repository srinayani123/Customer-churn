**Customer Churn Prediction using Ensemble Techniques**

**Project Overview**
This project addresses the pressing challenge of customer churn prediction in the telecom industry. Churn refers to customers discontinuing their services, which directly impacts revenue and long-term customer value. The dataset contains customer-level data including demographics, contract details, and subscribed services. The primary goal is to build robust machine learning models that can predict churn with high accuracy and interpretability. This was achieved by exploring multiple ensemble learning techniques, comparing their performance, and identifying key churn-driving factors for actionable insights.

**Data Preprocessing**
The preprocessing stage ensured the dataset was clean, consistent, and suitable for modeling. First, missing values in the TotalCharges column were identified and handled—non-numeric values were coerced into NaN and then removed or imputed. Categorical variables were carefully encoded: binary variables (e.g., Partner, Dependents, PhoneService) were label-encoded into 0/1, and multi-class categorical features like InternetService and Contract were one-hot encoded. The numerical features such as MonthlyCharges, tenure, and TotalCharges were standardized using StandardScaler to improve model convergence. The data was then split into stratified training and test sets to preserve churn distribution.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
EDA uncovered meaningful patterns and guided feature selection. Count plots and bar charts revealed that customers with short tenure, month-to-month contracts, and higher monthly charges were more likely to churn. A significant portion of customers lacked value-added services such as online security, backup, or tech support—features that appeared correlated with churn behavior. Histograms showed skewness in charge distributions, and correlation matrices highlighted relationships among features like InternetService, StreamingTV, and OnlineBackup. Pair plots, box plots, and multivariate analyses confirmed that Contract, tenure, and MonthlyCharges were strong indicators of churn. This visual understanding provided context for later model interpretation.

**Model Architecture**
The project implemented and compared several machine learning models. It began with a Decision Tree Classifier to establish a baseline. The simplicity of this model helped visualize decision rules but suffered from overfitting. To address this, Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers were introduced. Random Forest, an ensemble of decision trees, reduced variance by bootstrapping and aggregation. XGBoost added further improvements through sequential tree boosting, regularization, and optimized loss minimization. Finally, a Voting Classifier was used to aggregate predictions from multiple models, leveraging their collective strengths. Each model was trained on the same preprocessed feature set, and outputs were compared using consistent evaluation metrics.

-------------
**Hyperparameter Tuning**
Model performance was evaluated using multiple metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. Accuracy provided a general sense of correctness, but given the class imbalance (more non-churners than churners), precision and recall were more insightful. High recall was critical for capturing churners, while precision ensured marketing resources weren’t wasted on false positives. The best-performing model achieved ~82% accuracy, 0.80 precision, and 0.76 recall. Confusion matrices further broke down true/false positives/negatives. Feature importance plots identified that Contract, tenure, and InternetService were dominant predictors. These metrics, combined with domain insights, allowed a well-rounded assessment of model effectiveness.

**Sample Input/Output**
Example Input Record:

{
  "gender": "Female",
  "SeniorCitizen": 0,
  "Partner": "Yes",
  "Dependents": "No",
  "tenure": 4,
  "InternetService": "Fiber optic",
  "Contract": "Month-to-month",
  "MonthlyCharges": 78.5
}

Predicted Output:

{
  "Churn": "Yes",
  "Probability": 0.84
}

The model predicts a high likelihood of churn for this customer. Factors such as short tenure, a high monthly charge, and a month-to-month contract contribute to this assessment. This example illustrates the model's practical utility in real-time decision-making.

**Conclusion**

This project successfully applied ensemble learning to the real-world problem of churn prediction. Models like Random Forest and XGBoost outperformed traditional classifiers in both precision and recall, demonstrating their ability to generalize across varied customer behavior. The project also showed that careful preprocessing, EDA, and hyperparameter tuning are essential to unlocking the full potential of machine learning. The final models are interpretable and reliable, making them suitable for deployment in telecom business environments. The insights derived also aid in targeting vulnerable customer segments with effective retention strategies.

**Recommendations**

Target High-Risk Customers: Focus retention efforts on customers with short tenures and month-to-month contracts.

Promote Long-Term Contracts: Encourage annual contracts through discounts or loyalty programs.

Feature Expansion: Add behavioral data such as support ticket history or sentiment scores from surveys to enrich prediction.

Automate Monitoring: Integrate this model with customer relationship systems for real-time churn alerts.

Continual Learning: Retrain the model periodically with fresh data to adapt to evolving customer patterns and avoid model drift.
